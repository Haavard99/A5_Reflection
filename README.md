# Reflection

- The process of creating this tool consisted of several steps. In the beginning we had a few different options for what the tools main focus should be, and how big of a scope of information the tool should use. Because of this uncertenty early on the focus turned naturally to the IFC, and how to extract the information we thought we might need at a later point in the process. By working with these extractions it was made clear to us that the initial idea of creating a cost estimate of the whole bulding would require much more time, and would yield a very unfisihsed product at the end of the semester. The scope of the tool was therefore compromised to only extract beams, columns, slabs, walls and footings.

- After we got a chance to look at the MOLIO JSON file, our initial idea was to create the code as a brigde that generated a direct link between the properties in the IFC model and the pricebook. If there is something that would have significantly improved our work tool it would have been to achieve this, making the whole program automated, and not user-dependent. After a while trying to figure out how to accomplish this we concluded it would be quite difficult to do so seing that the  pricebook mostly consisted of strings and not numercal values, and was written in danish. 

- Talking to the representatives from Niras gave us a chance to ask questions about the usability of our tool. After a fun and intereseting yet important conversation it became clear to us that the tool would be somewhat useless if there was not an output that could later be made use of for other purposes then to just read. Our goal shifted from **«to quickly asses cost associated with design changes»**, to more of a economical view, where hopfully the output data could come in handy if other calculations or visualizations were to be made. 


## 1. Process of developing the tool
Choosing cost estimation as a usecase was not arbritary for us, because of the fact that we already touched by this topic on our bachelor thesis where we focused on building schools with CLT, as a substitution for concrete and steel, from a structural and economical perspective. Since we both are focusing our master on the subject of project management, cost as well substitute materials for concrete will be important factors for future bulding and therefore a fascinating issue that might very well become important when it comes to our thesis.

As for the freedom of choice of usecases, we personally liked being free in such decicion making, because working with things we find interesting, gives us an extra insetive to create something we are proud to hand over. We think that if there are enough usecases to cover most of the focus areas the students in the class have in their curriculum, almost everyone might find a usecase they can be somewhat passionate about.

That being said, we would have liked to see the lectures go more in depth in how the coding works, and deeper into how the IFC relationships are tangeled together. We think this might set a clearer vision for the students on what might they create as their final project. If they understand the basics of coding inside the IfcOpenshell from the begining, they might be more inclined to use other tools (A2_FutureBim) to be even more creative in their work.
