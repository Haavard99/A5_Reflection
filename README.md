# Reflection

- The process of creating this tool consisted of several steps. In the begining we had a few different opinons on what the tools main focus should be, and how big of a scope of information the tool should use. Because of this uncertenty early on the focus turned naturally to the IFC, and how to extract the information we thought we might need at a later point in the process. By working with these extractions it was made clear to us that the initial idea of creating a cost estimate of the whole bulding would require much more time, and would yield a very unfisihsed product at the end of the semester. The scope of the toool was therefore comprimised to only extract beams, columns, slabs and walls.

After we got a chance to look at the MOLIO JSON file, our initial idea was to create the code as a brigde that generated a direct link between the properties in the IFC model and the pricebook. After a while trying to figure out how to accomplish this we concluded it would be quite difficult to do so seing that the  pricebook mostly consisted of strings and not numercal values, and was written in danish. 

- Talking to the representatives from Niras gave us a chance to ask questions about the usability of our tool. After a fun and intereseting yet important conversation it became clear to us that the tool would be somewhat useless if there was not an output that could later be made use of for other purposes then to just read. Our goal shifted from **«to quickly asses cost associated with design changes»**, to more of a economical view, where hopfully the output data could come in handy if other calculations or visualizations were to be made. 


## 1. process of developing the tool
Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
YES, choosing cost estimation as a usecase was not random for us, due to the fact that we already touched by this topic on our bachelor thesis where we wrote our thesis together, focusing on building schools with CLT, as a substitution for concrete and steel. Since we both are focusing our master on the subject of project management, cost as well substitute materials for concrete will be important factors for future bulding and therefore a fascinating issue that might very well become important talkings points when it comes to our thesis.

Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
Personally we like to be quite free in such decicion making, because working with things we find interesting, gives us an extra insetive to create something we are proud to hand over. We think that if there are enough usecases to cover most of the focus areas the students in the class have in their curriculum, almost everyone might find a usecase they can be somewhat passionate about.

Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we haev more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
We would have liked to go more in depth in how the coding works, and deeper into how the IFC realtionships are tangeled together. We think this might set a clearer vision for the students on what might they create as the final project. If they understand the basics of coding inside the IFC from the begining, they might be more inclined to use other tools (A2_FutureBim) to be even more creative in their work.
